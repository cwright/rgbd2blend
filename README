rgbd2blend is a simple bridge between rgbdtoolkit and blender. 

building requires openframeworks and ofxRGBDepth,
using requires a kinect, RGBDtoolkit, blender, and the blender-meshfoot script. 

record with your DSLR+kinect using RGBDtoolkit
convert by dragging a group of pngs from the depth folder created by RGBDtoolkit into the app window
the .obj sequence will be output to /tmp/

texturing isnt yet supported in the converter, but the point is to just do it in blender.
video tutorial coming soon..
